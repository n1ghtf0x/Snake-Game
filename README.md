### Snake Game

<br />

This program was made by me completely from scratch. I did not use any ideas or code from other people.
Characters were also painted by me.

### Warning
<br/>
This program works only with third Python version, installed requirements and set file placement (png files need to be with py file in one folder)!
<br />

### Instructions

<br />
Your aim is to survive as long as possible by escaping dangerous fireball.
<br />
Fisrt go to the folder named with snake.py and images and execute command:
<br />
pip install -r requirements.txt
<br />
Then open snake.py by executing command:
<br />
python snake.py
<br />
To control main characters (wizard or snake) use arrow keys, to transform into snake press space button (i suggest doing this in the begging of the game, you can do this only once). If you die as a wizard you lose instantly, but if you die as a snake you transform back into wizard and game continues.
<br />
Game will always display your score after you die (score is based on survival time).
